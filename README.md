This repository offers a comprehensive Jupyter notebook exploring Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) using the pgmpy library. The primary focus is on grasping, implementing, and experimenting with HMMs across various scenarios, such as robot navigation and text correction.

## Objectives:

* Mastering Hidden Markov Models through practical implementation from data.
* Employing belief propagation for filtering and prediction tasks.
* Implementing the Viterbi algorithm to deduce the most probable sequence of hidden states based on evidence.
* Applying HMMs to real-world challenges like robot navigation in a grid and enhancing misspelled text.

## Key Concepts:

* Understanding the architecture and dynamics of Hidden Markov Models.
* Developing proficiency in probabilistic inquiries, including filtering, prediction, and evidence calculation.
